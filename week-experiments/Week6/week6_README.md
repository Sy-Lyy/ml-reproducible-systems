# Week 6 — Deployment Reproducibility

All previous layers converged this week.
Using FastAPI, Docker, and Streamlit, I deployed the model in a way that runs consistently across different machines and environments.
Environment variables via .env and the Dockerfile ensured consistent runtime parameters, while Streamlit demonstrated how the API can support different user interfaces.
Debugging PowerShell’s non-standard "curl" command with Invoke-RestMethod, and resolving Docker daemon issues, showed me that deployment reproducibility includes understanding infrastructure, not just code.
