# Week 3 — Testing as Reproducibility

This week made reproducibility measurable.
Writing unit tests with pytest and debugging via breakpoints in VS Code clarified how reliable code leads to reproducible outcomes.
Being able to pause execution and inspect variable values gave me deeper insight into program behavior.
Clear testing instructions in the repository ensure that anyone can re-run these checks effortlessly.
