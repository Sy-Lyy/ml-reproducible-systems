# Week 1 — Version Control Foundations

This week established the foundation of reproducibility through Git.
Working with commits, branches, merges, and reflog showed me that every change is recoverable and verifiable.
A key learning moment was understanding how to push locally created branches to GitHub and how VS Code integrates with Git.
I also realized that clear, descriptive commit messages are essential so that others can follow or reuse my repository without confusion.
