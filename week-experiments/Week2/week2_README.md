# Week 2 — Automation for Consistency

Reproducibility advanced through automation.
I created a prep_data.sh script and orchestrated tasks using a Makefile, learning that even small preprocessing steps must be automated to ensure consistent outputs.
A debugging moment — caused by incorrect file paths — taught me that reproducibility depends not only on automation but also on precision.
I also learned that documenting GitHub CLI authentication and run instructions is critical for others to reproduce my workflow.
